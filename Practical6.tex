	% Slide 5: Confidentiality and Anonymity
	\section{Confidentiality and Anonymity}
	\begin{frame}{Confidentiality and Anonymity}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Confidentiality:} Researchers must protect personal information obtained from participants and ensure it is not disclosed without consent.
			\item \textbf{Anonymity:} Ensuring that individuals cannot be identified from the data collected or the reports written.
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.5cm}
		\textbf{Examples:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use of pseudonyms in case studies.
